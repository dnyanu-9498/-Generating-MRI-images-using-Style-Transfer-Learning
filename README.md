 Generating MRI images using Style Transfer Learning  GAN with U-Net segmentation

The main objective of this research project is to build an optimized model using CycleGAN Generative adversarial network and U-net-based segmentation for generating artificial MRI images. Using the style transfer learning model generates a T2-weighted MRI image from the T1-weighted MRI image and vice-versa. T1-styled and T2-styled MRI images contain different values of attributes such as type of water, bone, fat, muscle, and tumours of brain tissues. A novel approach will be applied to GAN with U-Net segmentation to produce MRI images of different contrast levels to strengthen the quality of disease diagnosis in medical applications.
